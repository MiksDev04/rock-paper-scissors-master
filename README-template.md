## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to create a simple rock paper scissor game with a twist of adding two more weapons which are lizard and spock. I only discovered this twist only when I did my solution. It's goood that one of my childhood game have more in it than I have know.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing more games like this in the future
